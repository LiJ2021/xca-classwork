Coffee Shop/Restaurant Page

I created a responsive coffee shop ordering page with:
- A menu bar at the top
- A banner image for the restaraunt
- A form for ordering including a text field, a radio button, select box, and text area.

I chose an image from Unsplash by an artist known as liz99 that used zisha teapots, and I appreciate her calm and simple style. From the picture I was able to choose the colors that I wanted for the website, playing around with the Digital Color Meter and rgb in Visual Studio Code.  I feel that they continue the theme of calm and simplicity. 

I designed the website incorporating mobile-first concepts, and a media query to compensate for screens that were larger than 700px. I used flex grid and flex boxes to achieve this.
